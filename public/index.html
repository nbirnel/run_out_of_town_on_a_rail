    <h1>Welcome to Run Out of Town on a Rail</h1>

    <p>
    In which I snidely allude to some of my vague misgivings about Ruby on Rails

    This html is probably ill-formed, since I rarely write html by hand.
    Fortunately for me, browsers are incredibly clever and forgiving, 
    so I don't have to care.
