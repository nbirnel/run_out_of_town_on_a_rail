    Fortunately for me, browsers are incredibly clever and forgiving, 
    so I don't have to care.

    Wanna see some href <a href="../outlaws">Outlaws</a>?
    <%= link_to 'No Thanks.', likes_outlaws: false %>
    </p>

    <p>
    <%# RenÃ©e's more robust version from class %>
    Wanna see some link_to <%= link_to 'Outlaws', outlaws_path %>?
    <%= link_to 'No Thanks.', likes_outlaws: false %>
    </p>

    <p>
    <%= salutation %>
